# Given a set of positive numbers, determine if a subset exists whose sum is equal to a given number ‘S’.
#
# Example 1:#
# Input: {1, 2, 3, 7}, S=6
# Output: True
# The given set has a subset whose sum is '6': {1, 2, 3}
# Example 2:#
# Input: {1, 2, 7, 1, 5}, S=10
# Output: True
# The given set has a subset whose sum is '10': {1, 2, 7}
# Example 3:#
# Input: {1, 3, 4, 8}, S=6
# Output: False
# The given set does not have any subset whose sum is equal to '6'.

# The above solution has the time and space complexity of O(N*S),
# where ‘N’ represents total numbers and ‘S’ is the required sum.
