# Given a set of positive numbers, partition the set into two subsets with minimum difference between their subset sums.
#
# Example 1:#
# Input: {1, 2, 3, 9}
# Output: 3
# Explanation: We can partition the given set into two subsets where minimum absolute difference
# between the sum of numbers is '3'. Following are the two subsets: {1, 2, 3} & {9}.
# Example 2:#
# Input: {1, 2, 7, 1, 5}
# Output: 0
# Explanation: We can partition the given set into two subsets where minimum absolute difference
# between the sum of number is '0'. Following are the two subsets: {1, 2, 5} & {7, 1}.
# Example 3:#
# Input: {1, 3, 100, 4}
# Output: 92
# Explanation: We can partition the given set into two subsets where minimum absolute difference
# between the sum of numbers is '92'. Here are the two subsets: {1, 3, 4} & {100}.
